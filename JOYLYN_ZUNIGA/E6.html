            <h2>My Favorite Song</h2>
            <div class="text"><p>My favorite as of now is, "Love to Hate Me" by BLACKPINK. A side-track from their 1st ever album, "The Album"<br><br>
                The song seemingly talks about how the group has seen so many envious people grow around them as they skyrocketed into fame and success all over the world.<br><br>
                But aside from that, one of the reasons why I love the song is because its sending out a clear message saying that we shouldn't care about any negativity and hate in our lives.

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
How you love to hate me<br>
<br>
Kinda sad that you always been like that<br>
See me making waves, and you don't like that<br>
Driving through your puddles goin' splish, splash<br>
(Splish, splash, splish, splash)<br>
<br>
Stressing over nothing, baby, relax<br>
While you gettin' angry, I'ma kick back<br>
Only thing I think about is big stacks<br>
(Racks, racks)<br>
<br>
Negative days, negative nights<br>
Baby, you're wasting all your time<br>
<br>
I can't relate, I keep it light<br>
No-no-no drama in my life<br>
<br>
Wake up, yeah<br>
Makeup, maybe<br>
I need you, nah<br>
I been good lately<br>
Blowin' up<br>
Workin' busy<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
How you love to hate me<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
I'ma let you fade into the background<br>
Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud<br>
Keep on turnin' it up when you want me down<br>
<br>
Negative days, negative nights<br>
Baby, you're wasting all your time<br>
<br>
I can't relate, I keep it light<br>
No-no-no drama in my life<br>
<br>
Wake up, yeah<br>
Makeup, maybe<br>
I need you, nah<br>
I been good lately<br>
Blowin' up<br>
Workin' busy<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
How you love to hate me<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
Love to hate me, you hate to love me<br>
I'm takin' back what you've taken from me<br>
You're mistaken, honey, this something that<br>
Remind me why I be alone on my own<br>
If I needed you, I'd have you that I know, hold up<br>
I could do bad by myself, don't need help<br>
One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh well<br>
Felt, Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it<br>
'Cause I been through it, you wouldn't do it if it ain't foolish, stupid<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love, if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
How you love to hate me<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me<br>
<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
How you love to hate me<br>
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love<br>
<br>
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me<br>
