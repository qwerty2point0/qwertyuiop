        <center>I am Joylyn Zuniga
            19 years old, turning 20 <br>
            this coming June.<br>
            I lived in Shalom, Luna,Apayao.<br><br>
            Let me tell you something about myself.<br>
            It's usually quiet, but I want to dance and sing when I got travel.<br>
            I want to get a lot of attention usually, but i'm introverted,<br>
            so it's not usually obvious. I have a lot of sensitivity,<br>
            so I really need time to think alone.<br>
            I like planning things. I do what I have to do in advance,<br>
            I am a kind and friendly person to everyone.<br>
            I only like to play with people I'm close to and like.<br>
            It's delicate and sharp, but sometimes it's sloppy.<br>
            I can relate well and of counsel well<br>
            but the problem is that I feel empathize<br>
            about the other person's feelings like it's my job.<br>
            I am a more mature and quiet person than other's.<br>
            <br>
            The thing is, even if you're close to me,<br>
            there's a line you have to follow.<br>
            I'm a careful perfectionist.So I run 500 simulations before I act.<br>
            I often get sick when I'm stressed. I hate rude people the most.<br>
            And if the values that I think are different from mine,<br>
            I draw an extreme line and stay away from it.<br>
